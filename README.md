# 🚗 Istehaar: Mobile Advertising Redefined

Welcome to **Istehaar**, a project born out of our final year university hustle! 🎓 Our goal? To shake up the advertising game by reducing costs and boosting visibility for businesses. How did we do it? By strapping digital screens onto the backs of vehicles and turning them into rolling billboards! 🚚💡

## What’s Istehaar All About? 🤔

Istehaar is all about smart, mobile advertising. Instead of sticking ads in one place, we let them travel! By using vehicles as moving billboards, we give businesses a cost-effective way to reach more people, in more places, at the right time. With a Ruby on Rails backend, our platform lets advertisers manage their campaigns, track performance, and target specific areas based on where the vehicles are heading.

## What’s Inside? 🛠️

- **Ruby on Rails Backend:** The engine that powers the whole system, ensuring smooth communication between the digital screens, the ad server, and the advertiser’s dashboard.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration:** Each vehicle was equipped with a Raspberry Pi, which stored the ads locally and communicated with the server to ensure smooth ad delivery, even in areas with limited connectivity.
- **Geographical Targeting:** Ads were displayed based on the vehicle’s geographical location, allowing businesses to target specific audiences in real-time as the vehicle moved through different areas.
- **Dynamic Ad-Serving System:** Ads update in real-time based on the vehicle’s location, making sure the right message hits the right audience.
- **Advertiser Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for managing campaigns, tracking performance, and setting target areas.
